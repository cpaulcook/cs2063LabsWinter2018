# Lab 3

#### Background: 

For this lab you need to be familiar with with how to build an Intent
and how to construct and call new Activities:

* http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/starting-activity.html#BuildIntent
* http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/starting-activity.html#CreateActivity
  
Here is a list of common Intents. This isn't necessary for pre-lab reading, but you may find it valuable during this course and any future Android development.

* http://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-common.html


#### Objectives:

You are given an Android project containing one Activity. Your task is
to develop a thorough understanding of starting new activities by
Intents, briefly introduced last lab with more exploration below. The
Android API Guide succinctly states an "Intent is a messaging object
you can use to request an action from another app component" and for
that reason they are a very powerful tool for getting feature rich
applications running very quickly. We will cover:

* explicit and implicit Intents
* passing information with Intents
* application-specific Intent Filters
* permissions
* `startActivityForResult()`

The goal of this lab is to create a multiple Activity application that
uses multiple explicit and implicit Intents. We'll access activities
from within our application as well as request access for activities
outside our application. We'll access camera functionality as well as
the capability to send email using existing applications on the
device. We'll also explore a potential pitfall if the behavior of the
task backstack is misunderstood.

If you are using an emulator for this lab (e.g., on your own laptop)
you'll need to turn on emulated device camera access for your
emulator. This can be found under advanced settings when creating an
emulated device.

For any device you are using to test this lab (a real phone, emulator,
or Androidx86 VM) you will need to set up an email account on the
device if one is not already set up. This can be done on most Android
devices via ```Settings → Accounts → Add Account```.

#### Intent Types

New Activities are started by passing the ```startActivity()``` method an ```Intent``` parameter. Intents can be of **explicit** (stated) or **implicit** (implied) nature. Intents can be sent from an Activity component to start new Activities, which we’ve covered in some detail during Lab 2. Intents can also  start Services and Broadcast Receivers, which we'll cover in later labs, as well as be started _by_ Services and Broadcast Receivers.

_Explicit Intent_ - typically used to start a component (e.g.' ```Activity```/```Service```/```Broadcast Receiver```) that exists within your application project; something coded by you or imported for a specified purpose within your application. It is called explicit because you know the name of the component you intend to use, so you can explicitly announce it to the ```startActivity()``` method, and it will be handled as such.

_Implicit Intent_ - if you are calling for a component from another
application installed on the device, you may not have knowledge of the
component name that you are requesting; you just wish to make use of
the component if it’s available on the device. An application can
choose to specify if it contains components that satisfy certain
request types by supplying ```Intent Filters``` in their
```AndroidManifest.xml``` file. By providing such filters, their
application can make certain activities available to satisfy some
request from other applications. This creates even more modularity in
creating application services. If multiple applications on the device
satisfy some request (e.g., to take a photo), a list of possible
choices is presented to the user; users can then choose, or not, to
have their choice set as default behavior.
	
Investigate the constructors available for building ```Intent```
objects:

http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#lfields

Take a look at some of the public methods available to Intents. Note
in particular the various ```putExtra()``` methods. The option to
attach extra information to an ```Intent``` provides a great way to
send data between two Activities. By packing an ```Intent``` with
extras, its contents can be checked for, and then unpacked, in the
receiving ```Activity```. This is similar behavior to how we attached
counter values using ```savedInstanceState``` in
```onSaveInstanceState()``` from ```ActivityOne``` in Lab 2. Instead
of using ```savedInstanceState.put<<some_value_type>>()```, we instead
do ```intentName.putExtra(type, value)```.


#### Procedure:
Import the Lab 3 Skeleton code as a new project in Android Studio.

If you are using AndroidStudio 3 (i.e., on your own laptop) you will
get a Grable error. To fix this, make the following change in
```build.gradle (Project)```

Change

 ```classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.2.3'```

 to

```classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.3.2'```

##### Reminder Remember to make habit of adding a ```LogCat``` documentation ```String``` to all Activities and a ```Log.i``` method to each ```Activity``` method for testing purposes! Take a look at the following documentation and/or ```Lab 2``` Skeleton code for ```ActivityOne```.

http://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Log.html

**1.** Once imported, note the “Start” ```Button``` in the center of
the ```Main Activity``` layout. This ```Button``` doesn't have an
ID. Give it one (either using the Properties panel in the Design view
or by editing the XML in the Text view).

Programmatically capture a reference to this Start ```Button``` layout
component from ```MainActivity``` and give it a
[setOnClickListener()](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Button.html)
in the ```Activity```’s ```onCreate()``` method. Take a look at the
linked documentation or back to ```ActivityOne``` in Lab 2 if you
forget this procedure.

**2.** What's the second ```Activity``` class in the project? Take note of the Java resource file name.

**3.** Construct an [Intent](http://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters.html#ExampleExplicit) inside the ```setOnClickListener()``` and use it to start the second ```Activity```.
	
View the layout associated with this second ```Activity```. There are three buttons: one representing ```Camera``` access, one representing Email access, and one representing a Back ```Button```. Give each ```Button``` an ID.

**4.** Now capture references to these buttons. For each, define an
empty ```setOnClickListener()```.
* The Camera ```Button``` is going to send out an implicit
  ```Intent``` requesting a ```Camera``` application ```Activity```
  that can handle taking photos.
* The Email ```Button``` is going to send out an implicit ```Intent```
  requesting an Email ```Activity``` with which to send email.
* The Return ```Button``` will execute an explicit ```Intent```
  requesting ```Main Activity```; interesting task backstack
  implications will be explored from using this approach.

In Lab 2 we executed an explicit ```Intent``` to start
```ActivityTwo``` from the ```Context``` of ```ActivityOne```. Now we
will define our application's ```Intent``` to have some function
performed on its behalf using implicit intents.

When implicitly defining an ```Intent```, we pass along an ```Action
Constant```. This tells the device how to locate applications that
contain an ```Activity``` that is capable of responding to your
application's request. If a default application ```Activity``` has
been set to satisfy that function on the device, it will generally be
the ```Activity``` started.

Let's demonstrate this by announcing our application’s ```Intent``` to
send an email. We don't need to concern ourselves with the underlying
method an email application implements to succeed at transferring our
message to the recipient. We need only to announce our intention to
send email to the Android operating system and it will inform the user
what options are available.

We can provide information to the ```Activity``` we intend to
start. This information is sent along with the ```Intent``` as
attached extras when we call ```startActivity()``` or
```startActivityForResult()``` with the ```Intent``` we created as a
parameter. This extra information is then usable within the component
(eg. ```Activity```/```Service```/```Broadcast Receiver```) we
started.

Here are a list of possible Actions and Extras available for
communicating with email applications on the device, as well as email
```Intent``` creation examples:
http://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-common.html#Email

**5.** Develop your email ```Button```'s
```setOnClickListener()```. Build an email-only ```Intent``` that does
not include attachments. For testing, give your ```Intent``` three
extras: one for the recipient email addresses (just have one
recipient, and make it you), one for the the subject line “CS2063 Lab
3”, and one for the body of the email “This is a test email!”. The
final email ```Button``` action should be to ```startActivity()```
with your new ```Intent``` as a parameter.

**6.** Certain requested components may require access to device
hardware, such as the camera. If your application requests use of a
component that in turn will make use of such hardware, you must
announce that in your application’s manifest file.

Edit
[AndroidManifest.xml](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro.html)
to include a ```<uses-permission>``` tag to enable writing to external
storage (on-device storage that will be used to store photos that are
taken), and a ```<uses-feature>``` tag for the camera. The following
links contain information about how to do this:

* https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/files.html#GetWritePermission
* http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-feature-element.html#declared

**7.** Hardware feature use now declared, you can wire your camera ```Button```’s ```setOnClickListener()``` event to implicitly alert the operating system of your ```Activity```'s ```Intent``` to access to the camera functionality. Doing so will provide the user a list of applications to satisfy the request to take a photo. 

Use the example here to take a picture and save the full-size photo:
* https://web.archive.org/web/20150207090211/https://developer.android.com/training/camera/photobasics.html

(I've pointed you to an old version of the documentation. The
[latest version of this guide](https://developer.android.com/training/camera/photobasics.html#TaskScalePhoto)
does things in a slightly different way to support targeting recent
API levels. You're welcome to try this newer approach, but it's not
required.)

There is one small problem with the sample code. In ```createImageFile()``` change this line:

     mCurrentPhotoPath = "file:" + image.getAbsolutePath(); // Don't do this

to this:
 
     mCurrentPhotoPath = image.getAbsolutePath(); // Do this instead


**8.** We've saved the photo, and we know where we saved it (in ```mCurrentPhotoPath```), but we need to alert Android to add this file to the photos database so that other applications, like a gallery application, know about it. Add ```galleryAddPic()``` from the following link to your code:

http://developer.android.com/training/camera/photobasics.html#TaskGallery

But where should we call ```galleryAddPic()```? We launched our intent to take a photo using ```startActivityForResult()```. When the activity that is started completes, Android will call our ```Acivity```'s ```onActivityResult``` method. Learn about this method here:

http://developer.android.com/training/basics/intents/result.html#ReceiveResult

Implement ```onActivityResult``` in your ```Activity``` and have it call ```galleryAddPic()``` if it receives the correct request code and result code.


**9.** Now we have to make our back ```Button``` work. To do so, we
are going to build an ```Intent``` to explicitly call our
```MainActivity```. This is done similarly to how we built and started
an ```Intent``` to get from our ```MainActivity``` to
```ExternalActivityCalls```.

**10.** Run your application. Take a photo using the camera
button. Then send an email (to yourself), using the mail
button. From within the email app, attach the photo you just took as
an attachment. Open this email, and take a screenshot of it.

**11. ** Restart your application. From the
```MainActivity```, click the Start ```Button```. Then click Back,
then Start again. Do this a few times. Now, begin using the device
back button to traverse the task backstack.

Write a short description of your observations and relate this to what
you learned about the task backstack in the previous lab. Describe how
you could modify the implementation of your ```Activity```'s back
button to behave similarly to the device's soft-key back button.

**Deliverables** Show the following to the instructor or TA

* Your working app
* The screenshot you took of the email sent by your app
* Your answers to the questions about the back button
