# TryFire

This is an app demonstrating how you can use
[Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) in an Android app to easily add
functionality to an app that would otherwise require implementing a
server. The app lets you enter a message which, when sent, is shared
between all instances of this app.

To run this, follow step 1 from these
[instructions](https://www.firebase.com/docs/android/quickstart.html)
to create a Firebase account. Then set your Firebase URL in
MainActivity.java. Run the app on multiple devices at the same time
for maximum effect.

I used examples from steps 2-5 from the instructions to build this
app. I didn't bother with authenticating users or securing data. You
would probably want to do that in a non-toy app!
